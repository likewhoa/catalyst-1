NAME
----
catalyst - The Gentoo Linux Release Engineering meta-tool


SYNOPSIS
--------
*catalyst* ['OPTIONS'] [*-f* 'FILE' | *-C* 'KEY'='VALUE' ... | *-s* 'DATE']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*catalyst* is the tool that the Gentoo Release Engineering team
utilizes to build all Gentoo Linux releases. It is capable of building
installation stages, bootable LiveCDs, netboot images, and Gentoo Reference
Platform (GRP) sets. *catalyst* is also capable of providing a simple
tinderbox environment for ebuild/package testing.

For more information, please visit the *catalyst* project page
on the web at 'https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Catalyst'.


OPTIONS
-------
*--clear-autoresume*::
*-a*::
This option is to be used to clear any autoresume points that have been saved
for this target. It is used in conjunction with *-f*, *-C*, or both.

*--cli*|*-C* 'KEY'='VALUE' ...::
This option is to be used in place of a specfile. All options are passed
to *catalyst* on the commandline. Please note that this option must
be the last option passed to *catalyst* for everything to work correctly.

*--config*|*-c* 'FILE'::
Tell *catalyst* to use a user-defined configuration file. A sample
configuration file is installed at '/etc/catalyst/catalyst.conf'.

*--debug*::
*-d*::
Enable debugging mode

*--fetchonly*::
*-F*::
This tells *catalyst* to only fetch distfiles for the given packages without
performing any building.

*--file*|*-f* 'FILE'::
Tell *catalyst* to use the user supplied specfile.

*--help*::
*-h*::
Print the help message and exit

*--purge*::
*-p*::
Tell *catalyst* to clear all temporary directories, package caches, and
autoresume flags for the given target.

*--snapshot*|*-s* 'DATE'::
Create a Portage snapshot using the specified identifier stamp.

*--verbose*::
*-v*::
Enable verbose mode.

*--version*::
*-V*::
Print the version information and exit


EXAMPLES
--------
Using the commandline option (*-C*, *--cli*) to build a Portage snapshot:
---------------------------------------------------
# catalyst -C target=snapshot version_stamp=my_date
---------------------------------------------------

Using the specfile option (*-f*, *--file*) to build a stage target:
---------------------------------------------------
# catalyst -f stage1-specfile.spec
---------------------------------------------------

Using the snapshot option (*-s*, *--snapshot*) to package a Portage snapshot
using the datestamp 20051208:
---------------------------------------------------
# catalyst -s 20051208
---------------------------------------------------


FILES
-----
Example specfiles can be found in '/usr/share/doc/catalyst-{catalystversion}/examples'.
An example configuration file can be found at '/etc/catalyst/catalyst.conf'.

BUGS
----
An up-to-date list of Catalyst bugs can always be found listed on the Gentoo
Linux bug-tracking system at 'https://bugs.gentoo.org'.


NOTES
-----
*catalyst* is conceptually derived from the Gentoo livecd-ng and Gentoo
stager projects, both of which were used to create pre-1.4 Gentoo releases.

*catalyst* was originally conceived and coded by both Daniel Robbins and
John Davis. It is currently maintained by Chris Gianelloni and Eric Edgar and
has been mostly re-written.
