Catalyst is a release-buildcing tool for Gentoo.  If you use Gentoo
and want to roll your own live CD or bootable USB stick, this is the
way to go.  First, get a Gentoo development box and install the
necessary tools:

    # emerge -av dev-util/catalyst

Configure catalyst by editing `/etc/catalyst/catalyst.conf`, which is
well commented.  This sets up defaults such as hashing algorithms and
storage directories.  The defaults will probably be fine unless disk
space is an issue.

Assembling a starting point
---------------------------

Portage snapshot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a snapshot of your current Portage tree (you may want to
`emerge --sync` first):

    # catalyst --snapshot 20130131
    # ls /var/tmp/catalyst/snapshots/
    portage-20130131.tar.bz2
    portage-20130131.tar.bz2.CONTENTS
    portage-20130131.tar.bz2.DIGESTS

where the storage location is relative to the default
`$storedir=/var/tmp/catalyst`.

Stage3 tarball
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get a stage3 tarball (containing the build tools you'll need to
construct your stage1) from your local
https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/mirrors/[Gentoo mirror].

    $GENTOO_MIRROR/releases/$ARCH/current-stage3/

For example,

    http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/amd64/autobuilds/current-stage3-amd64/stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2

Grab the tarball and put it where catalyst will find it:

    # wget http://…/stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2
    # wget http://…/stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2.CONTENTS
    # wget http://…/stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2.DIGESTS.asc
    # sha512sum -c stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2.DIGESTS.asc
    # gpg --verify stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2.DIGESTS.asc
    # mv stage3-amd64-20121213.tar.bz2* /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default/

where the storage dir is `$storedir/builds/$source_subpath`
(`$storedir` from `catalyst.conf`, `$source_subpath` from your
`*.spec` file).

`.*spec` files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`.*spec` files tell catalyst about the system you're trying to build.
There are a number of examples distributed with catalyst.  Look in
`/usr/share/doc/catalyst-*/examples/`.  A minimal `*.spec` file for
this example is:

    # cat default-stage1-amd64-2013.1.spec
    subarch: amd64
    version_stamp: 2013.1
    target: stage1
    rel_type: default
    profile: default/linux/amd64/10.0/no-multilib
    snapshot: 20130131
    source_subpath: default/stage3-amd64-20121213

You may need to adjust the `subarch`, `snapshot`, and `source_subpath`
fields of the `*.spec` to match your target host, Portage snapshot,
and stage3 tarball name respectively.

For more details on what can go into a `*.spec` file, see
`catalyst-spec(5)`.

Building stage1
---------------

Now that everything's setup, run catalyst:

    # catalyst -f default-stage1-amd64-2013.1.spec

which will build the target and install something like:

    # ls /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default/stage1-amd64-2013.1.*
    /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default/stage1-amd64-2013.1.tar.bz2
    /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default/stage1-amd64-2013.1.tar.bz2.CONTENTS
    /var/tmp/catalyst/builds/default/stage1-amd64-2013.1.tar.bz2.DIGESTS

The name is an expansion of
`$storedir/builds/$rel_type/$target-$subarch-$version_stamp…`.

Building stage2 and stage3
--------------------------

Once you've built the stage1 from your seed stage3, you can use that
stage1 to build a stage2 and stage3.  The `*.spec` files are similar:

    $ diff -u default-stage{1,2}-amd64-2013.1.spec
    --- default-stage1-amd64-2013.1.spec
    +++ default-stage2-amd64-2013.1.spec

Gentoo stages
-------------

You can't compile a big pile of source code without an already
compiled toolchain, which is where Gentoo's stages come in.  The “base
system” contains the necessary build tools and supporting
infrastructure to get things going.  The stages are:

[options="header",frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|=======================================================================================
| Source         | Action                                                       | Result
| seed stage3    | Build packages listed in your profile's `packages.build`     | stage1
| stage1         | Rebuild the toolchain with the package tree's `bootstrap.sh` | stage2
| stage2         | Compile the base `@system` packages                          | stage3
| stage3         | Compile additional `@world` packages                         | stage4
|=======================================================================================

For stage1, Catalyst builds the stuff your profile says you need to
get started, using the tools in the seed stage3.  It uses Portage's
ability to merge packages into an alternatively-rooted filesystem
(`/tmp/stage1root`, using `ROOT` in `make.conf`).  This ensures that
only freshly-built packages end up in stage1.

A fresh stage1 has newly-compiled versions of everything you need to
build a full system, but all of the stage1 binaries were built with
tools from the seed stage3.  For stage2, Catalyst rebuilds a number of
critial packages (GCC, glibc, binutils, ...) using the `bootstrap.sh`
script distributed with the package tree.  Rebuilding the packages
using the packages themselves (instead of the seed stage3 tools) gives
an extra layer of separation from any crazy output that the seed
tooling may have generated.

Once we have a stage2, Catalyst builds all of the base system packages
for stage3, rebuilding any that were already built in stage2 (`emerge
-e @system`).  The `@system` set of packages is defined by `packages`
files in your cascading profile.  See
https://dev.gentoo.org/~ulm/pms/5/pms.html#x1-520005.2.6[the Package
Manager Specification] for details.

For more details on the differences between the stages, look at the
target helper scripts (e.g. `targets/stage1/*.sh`).

Building with a kernel
----------------------

If you're shooting for a live CD or bootable USB stick, you'll need to
compile your own kernel.  Here's how that works.

Genkernel
~~~~~~~~~

When you don't know exactly which kernel options you need, add
something like the following to your `*.spec`:

    boot/kernel: gentoo
    boot/kernel/gentoo/sources: gentoo-sources

You can still set `boot/kernel/<label>/config` when you're using
genkernel if you want to give genkernel some hints.

Genkernel alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to use a genkernel, your options are fairly limited.
The currently suggested route is to create your own binary kernel
package.

Stage4
------

`examples/stage4_template.spec` is a good template for building a
stage4 tarball.  Besides setting `target: stage4` and adjusting
`source_subpath`, I usually use `stage4/packages`, `stage4/rcadd`, and
the `boot/kernel` stuff described above.  This gives an almost
bootable stage that you can dump on a USB flash drive.

Live CDs
--------

Live CDs should be built in two stages: `livecd-stage1` (based on a
stage3 source) for building extra packages (along the same lines as a
stage4) and `livecd-stage2` (based on `livecd-stage1`) for setting up
the kernel, bootloader, filesystem, and other details.  See
`examples/livecd-stage*_template.spec` for some ideas.

Live USBs
---------

The easiest way to create a live USB is currently to install a live CD
ISO using
http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/Doc/isolinux#HYBRID_CD-ROM.2FHARD_DISK_MODE[isohybrid]
and `dd`:

    # isohybrid filename.iso
    # dd if=filename.iso of=/dev/sdX

replacing `X` with the appropriate drive letter for your USB disk.
See https://bugs.gentoo.org/251719[bug 251719] for details.

Running catalyst from a Git checkout
------------------------------------

If you're developing catalyst, you'll want to test your altered
version.  An easy way to run it without reinstalling is to setup a
local configuration file.  The checkout also includes a testpath file
which when sourced adds it's bin/ to PATH and it's checkout dir to
PYTHONPATH.  That terminal will then use the checkout bin/catalyst and
the checkout's python modules.

cd into the checkout directory and run:

    # source ./testpath
    # catalyst -c catalyst.conf -f path/to/your.spec

The local configuration file can use all the defaults except for
`sharedir`, which you should change to point to your development
directory:

    sharedir="/home/wking/src/catalyst"
